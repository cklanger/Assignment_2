problem1.py computes the time it takes a ship traveling with velocity v (input is ratio of v to c)
to travel a distance x (light years) in two frames: (i) in the frame of the spaceship; (ii) in the frame
of an observer on Earth. Uses time dilation formula.

problem2.py computes the binding energy B and the binding energy per nucleon B/A in MeV, given a mass number
A and an atomic number Z.
